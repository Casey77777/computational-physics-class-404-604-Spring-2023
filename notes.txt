PROGRAMMING PRINCIPLES

	1. gives correct answer
	2. clear and easy to read code (i.e. it documents itself)
	3. easy to use
	4. built up out of small programs 
	5. easy to modify and robust

	Plan ahead! Use pseudocode if necessary.

PSEUDOCODE

	1. flow chart
	2. small codes
	3. put together
	4. test

EFFICIENT PROGRAM

	Example:

	How to calculate 9^23 efficiently?
		9 x 9 x 9 x ... x 9 = 9^32  (32 products)
		or
		((((9^2)^2)^2)^2)^2 = 9^32  (5 products)
